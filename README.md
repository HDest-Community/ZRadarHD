### Notes
---
- This mod requires [AceCoreLib](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/acecorelib).
- It is recommended to disable base ZRadar's internal battery when using this mod.
- Loadout code is `zrd`.
- Radar mode, (over)scan distance, and scan angle all affect battery life.

### What does it do?
---
- It makes ZRadar require a physical item with a loaded battery in order to work. The item can spawn either in backpacks or be found randomly in the wild in place of computer area maps.
